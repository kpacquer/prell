Summary Page
=================================

The Summary page is a multi-cluster overview designed to give an at-a-glance view of the state of each cluster being monitored. It also acts as a portal to drill into more specific details about each cluster. Searching, sorting, and filtering options are available to help identify a specific cluster, or to compare a set of clusters side by side.
	
*Note*: When logging into InsightIQ for the first time, you will need to add clusters to be monitored from the *Settings* menu.

Monitored clusters appear in the UI as either cards or list items. These components provide a summary view of a clusters connection health, capacity, network throughput, OneFS version, node count and more.

A cluster's Connection health is represented by a yellow or red dog ear on the cluster's card or list view. The messaging varies depending on the state of connection health on the cluster.
