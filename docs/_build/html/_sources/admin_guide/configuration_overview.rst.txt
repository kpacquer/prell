Configuration and Setup overview
================================

InsightIQ system settings are managed in the InsightIQ web application. The InsightIQ Administrator account can manage InsightIQ monitored cluster, data store, email, and file system settings by using the InsightIQ web application. These settings are not available though the command-line interface. You can also manage network and authentication settings for the InsightIQ virtual machine.

**Note** Depending on which version of the OneFS operating system the monitored cluster is running, certain InsightIQ features might not be available.
